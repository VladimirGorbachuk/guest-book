A simple DRF-React application with server-side and client-side verification of data.
naming conventions, serializers usage were done according to official DRF manual.
React with hooks was used according to current best practices, Redux was used for state management, redux-toolkit was used for async api calls and slices of state.
Whitenoise is used in DRF but it should be changed to nginx for deployment.
As of now project is as expandable and as rewritable as I could (following definition of software as "easy to change" by Robert Martin)
